# 📅 Scrum Ceremonies & Events (Agile Fundamentals)

Scrum defines **5 core events** (ceremonies) that structure the workflow within a Sprint. Each serves a specific purpose and is time-boxed to ensure efficiency.

## 1. **Sprint Planning**

- **Purpose**: Define what can be delivered in the upcoming Sprint and how the work will be done.
- **Participants**: Scrum Team (Product Owner, Scrum Master, Developers)
- **Time-box**: Up to 8 hours for a one-month Sprint
- **Key Activities**:
  - Set the **Sprint Goal**
  - Select **Product Backlog items**
  - Create a **Sprint plan**

---

## 2. **Daily Scrum (Stand-up)**

- **Purpose**: Inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt as needed
- **Participants**: Developers
- **Time-box**: 15 minutes daily
- **Key Activities**:
  - What did I do yesterday?
  - What will I do today?
  - Are there any blockers?

## 3. **Sprint Review**

- **Purpose**: Inspect the Sprint outcome and gather feedback
- **Participants**: Scrum Team + Stakeholders
- **Time-box**: Up to 4 hours for a one-month Sprint
- **Key Activities**:
  - Demonstrate the **product increment**
  - Gather **feedback**
  - Update the **Product Backlog**

## 4. **Sprint Retrospective**

- **Key Activities**:
  - What went well?
  - What can improve?

## 5. **The Sprint**

- **Purpose**: Deliver a usable and potentially releasable product increment
- **Duration**: One month or less
- **Key Characteristics**:

## 6. **Product Backlog Refinement (a.k.a. Backlog Grooming)**

- **Purpose**: Keep the Product Backlog updated and ready for future Sprints
- **Participants**: Product Owner + Developers (Scrum Master may facilitate)
- **Time-box**: No fixed time-box, but typically up to 10% of team capacity per Sprint
- **Key Activities**:
  - Break down large items (epics) into smaller stories
  - Add details, estimates, and acceptance criteria
  - Re-prioritize based on new information
  - Ensure backlog items are "ready" for Sprint Planning

> Note: While not an official Scrum event, refinement is considered essential for smooth Sprint Planning.
