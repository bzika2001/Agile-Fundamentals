# üìÖ Scrum Ceremonies & Events (Agile Fundamentals)

Scrum defines **5 core events** (ceremonies) that structure the workflow within a Sprint. Each serves a specific purpose and is time-boxed to ensure efficiency.

Scrum Events are time-boxed opportunities for transparency, inspection, and adaptation. They provide regularity and minimize the need for other meetings.
---

### ‚è±Ô∏è 1. The Sprint (The "Heartbeat")
- **Purpose**: Deliver a usable and potentially releasable product increment
- **Duration**: One month or less
- **Key Characteristics**:
  - Encompasses all other events
  - A new Sprint begins immediately after the previous one ends
* **Core Idea:** The Sprint is the actual time-box during which the Scrum Team works to create a potentially shippable **Product Increment**. It's usually 1-4 weeks long and a new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous one.
* **20% Understanding:** The Sprint is the **container for all other Scrum Events**. It's a consistent, short cycle where the team focuses on delivering a valuable, usable piece of the product. Once a Sprint starts, its goal and scope are fixed (no changes that would endanger the Sprint Goal).

### üìÖ 2. Sprint Planning (The "What & How")

- **Purpose**: Define what can be delivered in the upcoming Sprint and how the work will be done.
- **Participants**: Scrum Team (Product Owner, Scrum Master, Developers)
- **Time-box**: Up to 8 hours for a one-month Sprint
- **Key Activities**:
  - Set the **Sprint Goal**
  - Select **Product Backlog items**
  - Create a **Sprint plan**
  
* **Core Idea:** An event at the beginning of each Sprint where the entire Scrum Team collaborates to define the **Sprint Goal**, select **Product Backlog Items** to work on, and create a plan for delivering them.
* **20% Understanding:** This is where the team answers two key questions:
    1.  **WHAT** will be delivered in this Sprint? (Sprint Goal & selected Product Backlog Items)
    2.  **HOW** will the selected work be done? (The plan to create the Increment)
* **Time-box:** Up to 8 hours for a one-month Sprint (shorter for shorter Sprints).
---

### üó£Ô∏è 3. Daily Scrum / Stand-up (The "Daily Check-in")

- **Purpose**: Inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt as needed
- **Participants**: Developers
- **Time-box**: 15 minutes daily
- **Key Activities**:
  - What did I do yesterday?
  - What will I do today?
  - Are there any blockers?
* **Core Idea:** A short, 15-minute time-boxed event for the Development Team to inspect progress toward the **Sprint Goal** and adapt the **Sprint Backlog** as necessary. It's a meeting *for* the Development Team.
* **20% Understanding:** It's a **daily sync-up** for the team to coordinate their work, identify any blockers, and adjust their plan to meet the Sprint Goal. It's *not* a status report to the manager.
* **Typical Questions (though flexible):**
    1.  What did I do yesterday that helped the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?
    2.  What will I do today to help the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?
    3.  Do I see any impediment that prevents me or the Development Team from meeting the Sprint Goal?

### üìà 4. Sprint Review (The "Show & Tell")

- **Purpose**: Inspect the Sprint outcome and gather feedback
- **Participants**: Scrum Team + Stakeholders
- **Time-box**: Up to 4 hours for a one-month Sprint
- **Key Activities**:
  - Demonstrate the **product increment**
  - Gather **feedback**
  - Update the **Product Backlog**
* **Core Idea:** An informal event held at the end of the Sprint to inspect the **Product Increment** and adapt the **Product Backlog** if needed. Stakeholders are invited to collaborate on what to do next.
* **20% Understanding:** This is the **demo and feedback session**. The team shows *what they built* (the Increment), and stakeholders provide feedback, which helps the Product Owner refine the Product Backlog for future Sprints.
* **Time-box:** Up to 4 hours for a one-month Sprint (shorter for shorter Sprints).
---

### üîÑ 5. Sprint Retrospective (The "Improvement Loop")

- **Purpose**: Reflect and improve team processes
- **Participants**: Scrum Team
- **Time-box**: Up to 3 hours for a one-month Sprint
- **Key Activities**:
  - What went well?
  - What can improve?
  - What will we try in the next Sprint?
* **Core Idea:** An event for the Scrum Team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next Sprint. It's about improving *how* the team works.
* **20% Understanding:** This is the **"lessons learned" meeting**. The team reflects on the past Sprint to identify:
    1.  What went well?
    2.  What could be improved?
    3.  What specific actions will we take to improve in the next Sprint?
* **Time-box:** Up to 3 hours for a one-month Sprint (shorter for shorter Sprints).

## 6. **Product Backlog Refinement (a.k.a. Backlog Grooming)**

- **Purpose**: Keep the Product Backlog updated and ready for future Sprints
- **Participants**: Product Owner + Developers (Scrum Master may facilitate)
- **Time-box**: No fixed time-box, but typically up to 10% of team capacity per Sprint
- **Key Activities**:
  - Break down large items (epics) into smaller stories
  - Add details, estimates, and acceptance criteria
  - Re-prioritize based on new information
  - Ensure backlog items are "ready" for Sprint Planning

> Note: While not an official Scrum event, refinement is considered essential for smooth Sprint Planning.

## üóÇÔ∏è Bonus: Product Backlog Refinement (Optional but Recommended)

- **Purpose**: Prepare the backlog for future Sprints
- **Participants**: Product Owner + Developers
- **Key Activities**:
  - Clarify, break down, and prioritize items
  - Ensure backlog is ready for planning

## üë©‚Äçüè´ How to Help Your Team Adopt Scrum Events (As a Delivery Lead)

As a Delivery Lead, your role is to ensure these events are **valuable, efficient, and embraced** by the team, not just performed.

1.  **Champion the "Why":**
    * **Explain the Purpose:** Don't just schedule meetings. Explain *why* each event exists and *what value* it brings to the team and the product. "Daily Scrum isn't a status report, it's our daily coordination to hit our goal!"
    * **Connect to Pain Points:** "Remember those times we started work without clear goals? Sprint Planning prevents that." "Remember when we spent days on a feature nobody wanted? Sprint Review fixes that."

2.  **Facilitate, Don't Dominate:**
    * **Time-box Strictly:** Strictly adhere to the time-boxes for each event. This shows respect for everyone's time and keeps meetings focused. Use a visible timer!
    * **Ensure Collaboration:** For Sprint Planning and Retrospectives, actively facilitate discussions, ensuring everyone contributes. For Daily Scrums, make sure it's the *team's* meeting, not a report to you.
    * **Protect the Events:** Don't let other meetings or interruptions bleed into Scrum Events.

3.  **Optimize for Value:**
    * **Pre-Planning for Planning:** Ensure the Product Owner comes to Sprint Planning with a well-refined and prioritized Product Backlog. This is crucial for a smooth planning session.
    * **Engage Stakeholders for Review:** Encourage relevant stakeholders to attend the Sprint Review. Help the team prepare a compelling demo that highlights the value delivered.
    * **Actionable Retrospectives:** Guide the team to identify *specific, actionable* improvements in the Retrospective, not just complaints. Follow up on these actions in the next Sprint.

4.  **Remove Impediments:**
    * **Listen During Daily Scrums:** Pay close attention to blockers mentioned. Your role is to jump in *after* the Daily Scrum to help remove those obstacles for the team.
    * **Support Event Adherence:** If the team struggles with an event (e.g., Daily Scrum drags on), coach them on techniques to make it more effective.

5.  **Be Patient and Inspect & Adapt Your Approach:**
    * **It's a Journey:** Adopting Scrum isn't instant. There will be bumps. Encourage the team to reflect on how *they* are doing the events in their own retrospectives.
    * **Continuous Improvement for Events Themselves:** In retros, ask: "How could our Sprint Planning be better?" or "Did our Sprint Review feel valuable this time?"

By nurturing these events, you'll help your team establish a predictable rhythm, improve continuously, and consistently deliver value ‚Äì the true essence of Agile!
