# üß≠ Agile Roles in Context: Navigating Organizational Structures : Responsibilities and Influence

In Agile environments, roles extend beyond the traditional Scrum team to encompass various stakeholders who influence project success. Here's an overview of key roles, their responsibilities, and how they interact within an Agile framework.


Adopting Agile doesn't always mean a complete overhaul of an organization's structure or titles overnight. Instead, it often involves understanding how existing roles contribute to and interact with the core Agile team roles (Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team). This section explains how various common organizational roles fit into an Agile context.

##  üèõÔ∏è 1. Project Sponsor

**Traditional Role:** Typically, the individual or group that provides the financial resources for the project, champions it, and holds ultimate accountability for its success.

**Responsibilities**:

- **Strategic Alignment**: Ensures the project aligns with the organization's strategic objectives.

* **Focus on Value & Outcome:** In Agile, the sponsor shifts from micromanaging tasks to focusing on the overall business value and outcomes being delivered.
* **Key Stakeholder:** They are a critical stakeholder for the Product Owner and may participate in higher-level reviews or strategic planning.

**Your Role as a Delivery Lead:**
* **Manage Expectations:** Help the sponsor understand Agile's iterative nature, emphasizing value delivery over fixed-scope contracts.
* **Communicate Value:** Regularly communicate the business value being delivered through working increments.
