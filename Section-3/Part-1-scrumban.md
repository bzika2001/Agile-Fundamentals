# 📘 Scrumban Methodology: An In-Depth Guide for Delivery Leads

## 📖 Overview

**Scrumban** is a hybrid Agile methodology that merges the structured framework of **Scrum** with the flow-based principles of **Kanban**.  
Originally designed to help teams transition from Scrum to Kanban, Scrumban has evolved into a standalone framework that offers flexibility, continuous improvement, and efficiency.

### Key Characteristics:

- **Flexibility:** Adapts to changing project requirements.
- **Visualization:** Utilizes Kanban boards for real-time tracking.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Encourages regular retrospectives.
- **Pull-Based System:** Team members pull tasks based on capacity.

## ⚖️ Scrumban: The Debate

### Advantages:

- **Adaptability:** Combines Scrum's structure with Kanban's flexibility.
- **Efficiency:** Reduces overhead by eliminating unnecessary ceremonies.
- **Transparency:** Enhances visibility into work status through visual boards.

### Challenges:

- **Lack of Standardization:** Without strict guidelines, teams may struggle with consistency.
- **Potential for Scope Creep:** Continuous flow can lead to uncontrolled addition of tasks.

> **Coaching Tip:** Emphasize defining clear policies and boundaries to prevent scope creep.

## 🔄 Continuous Flow in Scrumban

Scrumban uses a continuous flow model instead of Scrum’s sprints.

### Implementation:

- **Kanban Board:** Visualize tasks in stages.
- **WIP Limits:** Limit simultaneous work to avoid overload.
- **Pull Mechanism:** Team members pull tasks as they're ready.



> **Coaching Tip:** Reevaluate WIP limits periodically based on team capacity.

## ⏳ Timeboxing in Scrumban

Even in a flow-based model, timeboxes can be useful.

### Use Cases:

- **Planning Sessions:** Bi-weekly or monthly to reassess priorities.
- **Retrospectives:** Regular meetings to reflect and improve.

> **Coaching Tip:** Use timeboxes to balance agility with accountability.

## ❄️ Feature Freeze

A practice to stabilize work before deadlines or major releases.

### How to Use:

- Define clear conditions for a freeze.
- Communicate with all stakeholders to prevent misunderstandings.

> **Coaching Tip:** Feature freezes should align with delivery goals, not be arbitrary.

## 🎯 Target Audience for Scrumban

### Ideal Teams:

- Maintenance/support teams.
- Projects with rapidly changing scope.
- Scrum teams transitioning to Kanban.

> **Coaching Tip:** Match the methodology to the team's maturity and project context.

## 🚫 Common Anti-Patterns

- **WIP Overload:** Teams ignoring limits.
- **No Retrospectives:** Missing process improvement.
- **Undefined Rules:** Leads to confusion and inconsistency.
- **Poor Communication:** Leaves stakeholders out of the loop.

> **Coaching Tip:** Use visual boards and metrics to make these issues visible.

## 🗣️ Applying Scrumban in Agile Ceremonies

### Daily Standups:

- Focus on task flow and blockers.
- Use visual boards to structure the discussion.

### Reviews:

- Demonstrate completed work.
- Invite feedback and update the backlog accordingly.

### Retrospectives:

- Reflect on what’s working and what isn’t.
- Agree on process tweaks and improvements.

> **Coaching Tip:** Make ceremonies consistent, even in a flow-based environment.
