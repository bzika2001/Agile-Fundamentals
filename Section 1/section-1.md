# Agile fundamentals and Values

## Agile manifesto
( *number of resources your are using*)
We are **uncovering better ways** of developing software by doing it and helping others do it.
Through this work we have come to vallue:
- **Individuals and interacts** : Over processes and tools
- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
- **Responding** to change over following a plant

**uncovering better ways** means learning.
Learning as an organisation (or a team) on how to get better at developing software.

### Agile Value 1: Individuals and Interactions over Processes and Tools
Means we value people
This foundational Agile value stresses that the **people involved in a project and how they communicate are more important than rigid processes or sophisticated tools.** While processes and tools certainly have their place, their primary role should be to *enable and support* human interaction, not to dictate or replace it.

## Why This Value Matters: The Benefits of Prioritizing People

* **Faster Problem Solving:** Direct, immediate communication helps resolve issues and clarify misunderstandings far quicker than formal, drawn-out processes.
* **Better Solutions:** Complex problems are best tackled through collaborative brainstorming and diverse perspectives, leading to more innovative and effective solutions.
* **Stronger Team Cohesion:** Regular interaction builds trust, fosters psychological safety, and creates a more connected and resilient team environment.
* **Increased Empowerment:** When individuals are trusted to communicate directly and solve problems together, it boosts their sense of ownership and accountability.

## Common Pitfalls: Signs Your Team Might Be Missing This Value

Keep an eye out for these anti-patterns, which indicate an over-reliance on processes or tools:

* **"Just send me an email/ticket":** A default to asynchronous, formal communication even when a quick chat would suffice.
* **"The process says so":** Using predefined rules as an excuse to avoid adaptability or creative problem-solving.
* **Ineffective Meetings:** Meetings become status updates where people talk *at* each other, rather than genuine collaborative discussions.
* **Excessive Documentation:** Creating overly detailed documents for simple tasks that could be resolved with a brief conversation.
* **Siloed Work:** Team members primarily pass tasks through a tool (e.g., Jira) without direct collaboration.
* **Tool Complexity Paralysis:** More time is spent configuring or complaining about a tool than actually using it to facilitate work.

## Your Role as a Delivery Lead: Fostering "Individuals and Interactions"

As a Delivery Lead, you're key to cultivating this value. Here's how:

* **Lead by Example:** Model the behavior you want to see. Opt for direct conversations (in-person, call, video) over email when possible.
* **Promote Collaboration:** Encourage practices like **pair programming/work**, **swarming on blockers**, and interactive **Daily Scrums** or team huddles where the team syncs *together*.
* **Simplify Processes & Tools:**
    * **Question Necessity:** Regularly ask: "Does this process truly add value, or is it creating unnecessary bureaucracy?"
    * **Optimize:** Choose lightweight, user-friendly tools that genuinely *support* communication and collaboration, rather than hindering it.
* **Cultivate Psychological Safety:** Create an environment where team members feel safe to speak up, ask questions, admit mistakes, and offer constructive feedback without fear.

By prioritizing direct interaction and valuing your team members' contributions, you'll build a more effective, adaptable, and engaged team.
