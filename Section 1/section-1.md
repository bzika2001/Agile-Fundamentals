# Agile fundamentals and Values

### Agile manifesto
( *number of resources your are using*)
We are **uncovering better ways** of developing software by doing it and helping others do it.
Through this work we have come to vallue:
- **Individuals and interacts** : Over processes and tools
- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
- **Responding** to change over following a plant
